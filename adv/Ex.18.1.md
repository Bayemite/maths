# Exercise 18.1 Q1-10

## 1.
(a) Julian deposits $1000 in an investment account that is paying a monthly interest rate of 0.3%, with the
interest compounded monthly. Calculate the value of the investment after 12 months.

$A = P(1+r)^n $  
$= 1000(1+0.3\%)^{12}$  
$= \$1036.60$

(b) Minh deposits $2000 in an investment account that is paying a monthly interest rate of 0.5%, with the
interest compounded monthly. Calculate the value of the investment after 10 months.

$A = 2000(1+0.5\%)^{10}$  
$= \$2102.28$

(c) Ben deposits $3400 in an investment account that is paying a monthly interest rate of 0.35%, with
the interest compounded monthly. Calculate the value of the investment after 20 months.

$A = 3400(1+0.35\%)^{20}$  
$= \$3646.08$

## 3.
Brian and Faye plan to have $25 000 in an investment account in 10 years time to pay for a cruise.
The interest rate for the account will be fixed at 4.2% per annum, compounded monthly.
How much do they need to deposit into the account to achieve this goal?
Round your answer to the next dollar.

$25000 = P\left(1 + \dfrac{4.2\%}{12} \right)^{120} $

$P = \dfrac{25000}{1.0035^{120}} $

$ = \$16438 $

## 4.
What amount must be invested now at 6% per annum, compounded monthly, so that in 4 years it will have
grown to $50 000?

$50000 = P\left(1+\dfrac{6\%}{12}\right)^{48} $  
$P = \$39354.92 $

## 5.
The table shows the compounded values of $1.

| 1      | 1.010 | 1.020 | 1.030 | 1.040 | 1.050 | 1.060 |
| 2      | 1.020 | 1.040 | 1.061 | 1.082 | 1.103 | 1.124 |
| 3      | 1.030 | 1.061 | 1.093 | 1.125 | 1.158 | 1.191 |

| 8      | 1.083 | 1.172 | 1.267 | 1.269 | 1.477 | 1.594 |

Use this table to calculate the value of the following investments.

(a) Stuart invests $2500 for 4 years at an interest rate of 3% per half year compounded half yearly.

$2500 \times 1.267 = \$3167.50$

(b) Karina invests $5600 for 2 years at an interest rate of 1% per quarter, compounded quarterly.

$5600 \times 1.083 = \$6064.80$

(c) Aaliyah invests $3000 for 5 years at an interest rate of 5% per annum compounded yearly.

$3000 \times 1.276 = \$3828$

(d) Achim makes two investments of $4000 each. His first investment is for 3 years at an interest rate of
6% per annum compounded yearly.
His second investment is for 3 years at an interest rate of 3% per half
year compounded half yearly.  
Which investment earns the most interest and by how much?

$A_1 = 4000(1+6\%)^3 = \$4764.06$  
$A_2 = 4000(1+3\%)^6 = \$4776.21$

The second investment earns the most interest, by $\$12.15$.

*Use the table of values given in question 5 to answer question 10.*

Fabio makes a one-off deposit of $3000 into an investment account that pays interest at the rate of 3% p.a.,
compounded yearly.

(a) How much money is in the account after 3 years?

$A=3000 \times 1.093$
$=3279$

money in this account for another 3 years, what is the value of the investment at the end of this time?

$A=3279*1.191$
$= 3905.289$

and then an interest rate of 5% p.a. compounded yearly for the next 3 years. What is the value of the
investment at the end of 6 years with this bank?
